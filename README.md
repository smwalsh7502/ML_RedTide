# RedTide Machine Learning

Harmful algal blooms are prevalent issue in marine and freshwaters around the world, causing damage to both ecosystem health and human health. 
The toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis has caused significant economic damage along the West Florida coast in recent years. 


As a research assistant, I will be working to develop a Red tide water quality Management Application (REMApp). 
The overarching objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based tool for predicting red tide in the Gulf of Mexico along the West Florida Shelf.

Data sourced from [USGS.gov](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)

In this portion, the data was gathered for nine rivers total along the south west Florida shelf. 

USGS River Stations Included:
* Tampa Bay (USGS 2306647)
* Peace River (USGS 2296750)
* Lake Okeechobee (USGS 2274325)
* Suwanee River (USGS 2323500)
* Withlacoochee River (USGS 2319000)
* Hillsborough River (USGS 2303330)
* Little Manatee River (USGS 2300500)
* Myakka River (USGS 2298830)
* Caloosahatchee Canal (USGS 2292000).

Rivers were organized by size and the weekly average discharge was plotted over time with large rivers in one graph and small rivers on another. Later, we will analyze this collected data to assess wether or not there is a correlation between river discharge and appearance of red tide.
