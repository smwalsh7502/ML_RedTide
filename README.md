# ML_RedTide

Harmful algal blooms are prevalent issue in marine and freshwaters around the world, causing damage to both ecosystem health and human health. 
The toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis has caused significant economic damage along the West Florida coast in recent years. 
As a research assistant, I will be working to develop a Red tide water quality Management Application (REMApp). 
The overarching objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based tool for predicting red tide in the Gulf of Mexico along the West Florida Shelf. 
I will have the opportunity to explore the impact of various factors on these blooms, including upwelling, and wind speed and direction.
Additionally, I will investigate the role of Chattahoochee River and Peace River flow, and the nutrients they supply in regulating these algal blooms.
